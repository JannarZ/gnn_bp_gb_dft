# GNN model for BP GB total energy prediction
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrate the process of transffering blue phosphorene (BP) grain boundary (GB) structures into graphs and training of a graph neural network model (GNN) for the total energy prediction. File [gnn_downsample_mae_dft](gnn_downsample_mae_dft.csv) contains all the data for downsampling the complete DFT dataset discussed in the paper. Training labels are the energy values evaluated by the density functional theory (DFT).
